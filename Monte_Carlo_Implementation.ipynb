    "Let's say we are trying to calculate the value of a state S0. In the first visit method, after we reach that state, start to sum the rewards until the end of the episode. If the state S0 appears again, ignore it and don't start counting again. The value of the state S0 is the average sum for all episodes where S0 appears\n",
    "\n",
    "The every visit method works in a similar way, but if the state S0 reappears in the episode, we start another sum (and keep summing the previous sums too). Then you average all sums for the value of that state.\n",

    "In the above numerical example, if we start counting after the first visit, then the rewards that appear after the state A in the first episode are 3+2-4+4-3=2, and in the second episode it is 3-3=0 (we start from the second observed sample since you start counting when the state A appears). So V(A) is the average of 2 and 0, which is 1. Likewise, the reward for the B state in the first episode is the average between -4+4-3=-3 and -2+3-3=-2 which is (-3-2)/2=-5/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the every state case, you count after every appearance of A. So the sum in the first episode for the first appearance is 3+2-4+4-3=2, for the second appearance is 2-4+4-3=-1 and third is 4-3=1. For the second episode it's simply 3-3=0 since it appears only one time. So (2-1+1+0)=1/2. You do likewise for state B, averaging 4 values in total (one for each time B appears).\n",

The function `generate_episode_from_stochastic_action` samples an episode using this policy. Each episode has a number of experiences. The episode ends when the `done` variable is set to True by the `env.step(action)` function.\n",

In particular, `episode[i]` returns $(S_i, A_i, R_{i+1})$, and `episode[i][0]`, `episode[i][1]`, and `episode[i][2]` return $S_i$, $A_i$, and $R_{i+1}$, respectively.\n",
